            <p>Countess Ada Augusta Byon, also known as the Countess of Lovelace, born on December 10, 1815, was the daughter of the famous poet <a href="#">Lord George Gordon Byron</a> (at whose mansion in Geneva Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein). She worked closely with <a href="#">Charles Babbage</a>, the inventor who designed what he called the <a href="#">Analytical Engine</a>, a mechanical general-purpose computer, that computer scientists would now describe as <a href="#">Turing-complete</a>. Although Babbage never successfully built the machine, his design was sound; 153 years later, a working version was completed in London.</p>
            <p>Ada translated a French transcript of one of Babbage's lectures. In one of her notes, she described an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to compute <a href="#">Bernoulli numbers</a>. This is considered by many to be the first computer program ever written. Some historians dispute the accuracy of this interpretation. However, regardless of her status as a programmer, she realized what Babbage did not: That beyond merely doing mathematical computations, numbers could be used to represent other entities, which could be manipulated algorithmically. She speculated that in principle, such a device could be made to, for example, compose music. In this way, she can be regarded as a visionary who anticipated the computer revolution of the mid-20th century.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">[The Analytical Engine] might act upon other things besides number, were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations, and which should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engine...Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.</blockquote>
